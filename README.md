# Anomaly-Detection-using-Autoencoders
## Overview
This jupyter notebook explains how one can create an Autoencoder to detect Anomalies.
## Requirements
* Pyhton 3.x
* TensorFlow 2.x
* Pandas 
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
## Dataset used
The dataset used for this explanation is ECG5000 available on [this](http://www.timeseriesclassification.com/Downloads/ECG5000.zip) link.<br>
The dataset contains ECG readings.<br>
This dataset contains the labels in the first column and the rest of the columns contain the features.
## Framing the Problem Statement
Here it is considered as a non time series problem where we have to detect anomalies in the dataset.
## Explanation
I have written an article explaining this [here]().
## How to use
You can simply download the jupyter notebook and run it.<br>
Feel free to make changes.
## Contributions
